      this app is here to make college life less boring and more connected.
    </p>

      Whether you’re a first-year explorer or a final-year legend, CollegeVibe helps you find your tribe, keep up with events,

    <h2><span class="emoji">👨‍💻</span> About the Developer</h2>
    <p>
      Hey there! I'm <span class="highlight">Salman Ahamed</span> — currently pursuing Computer Science at Sir Syed Institute under Kannur University. 
      I’m that guy who’s way more into building projects than writing theory answers. 
      My mission? To code things that actually help people (and maybe, just maybe, win a few bets while getting fit 🏋️‍♂️).
    </p>
    <p>
      I built this app from scratch using <span class="highlight">Django</span>, <span class="highlight">WebSockets</span>, a pinch of magic, and many sleepless nights.
      This isn’t just another project for the resume — this is my playground, my experiment lab, my proof that passion + code = impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently on the journey to become a full-stack wizard — with React, Next.js, DRF, and maybe a few dragons 🐉 on the way.
      If you're reading this and you're a recruiter, mentor, or just a curious soul, feel free to hit me up! I love talking tech, motivation, and making boring things awesome.
    </p>
